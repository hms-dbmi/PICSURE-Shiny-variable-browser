# PICSURE Variable browser

This `ShinyApp` is a proof of concept to allow users for easily browsing and searching variable names within the [PIC-SURE BDC UI](https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov). Additional benefits of the `ShinyApp` are the searching capabilities and dynamic filtering features.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

2. Open the `Shiny_BDC.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to get your user profile token from the [PIC-SURE BDC UI](https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov)

3. Save your token in the root folder of this repository as `token.txt`

4. Execute the `Shiny_BDC.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in full to launch the `ShinyApp`

## Libraries
 
Currently, the `ShinyApp` is mainly based on the [DT library](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/
)
